# nanodom

a _super_ simple DOM/tree implemention built on top of [`quick-xml`](https://crates.io/crates/quick-xml).

meant to be as ergnomic as possible (parsing directly to and from `&str`), and allow maximal flexibility

inspired by [`minidom`](https://crates.io/crates/minidom), but is meant to do even less.
